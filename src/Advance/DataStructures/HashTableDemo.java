/**The Hashtable class provides a means of organizing data based on some user-defined key structure.
 * <p>For example, in an address list hash table you could store and sort data based on a key such as ZIP code rather than on a person's name.
 * <p>The specific meaning of keys with regard to hash tables is totally dependent on the usage of the hash table and the data it contains.
 * <p>Following are the important points about Hashtable âˆ’<p>
 * {@code 1) In this any non-null object can be used as a key or as a value.}<p>
 * {@code 2) If many entries are to be made into a Hashtable, creating it with a sufficiently large capacity may allow
 * the entries to be inserted more efficiently than letting it perform automatic rehashing as needed to grow the table.}
