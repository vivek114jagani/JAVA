/**The BitSet class implements a group of bits or flags that can be set and cleared individually.
 * <p>This class is very useful in cases where you need to keep up with a set of Boolean values;
 * you just assign a bit to each value and set or clear it as appropriate.
 * <p>The Java BitSet class creates a special type of array that holds bit values. The BitSet array can increase in size as needed.
 * This makes it similar to a vector of bits. This is a legacy class but it has been completely re-engineered in Java 2, version 1.4.
 * <p>The Java BitSet class implements a vector of bits that grows as needed.
 * <p>{@code Following are the important points about BitSet âˆ’}
 * <pre> {@code 1) A BitSet is not safe for multithreaded use without external synchronization.
 * 2) All bits in the set initially have the value false.
 * 3) Passing a null parameter to any of the methods in a BitSet will result in a NullPointerException.} </pre>
